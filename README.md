C# Projects — Advanced (.NET & Entity Framework)
This repository contains two projects from my C# and .NET course.
They focus on working with ASP.NET MVC, Entity Framework, and database logic.
First-  Car Insurance (ASP.NET MVC + Entity Framework)
This project is an MVC web app that simulates a car insurance website.
Users enter policy details, and the application calculates an insurance quote using business logic such as:
Age of driver
Vehicle year
Vehicle make & model
Number of speeding tickets
DUI history
There is also an Admin dashboard that allows staff to view all customer quotes.
Technologies used
ASP.NET MVC
Entity Framework 6
SQL Server / LocalDB

Second- Code-First Student App (Console + EF Code First)

Adds one student record automatically
This project helped me learn:
Code-First migrations
